## Design

#### A. Modeling Action according to State

First, we need to investigate how users determine their actions according to their states. An action is whether or not the agent accepts a relay request from other agents. The agent's state includes remaining battery charge, data quality, and relationship with requester.

Each agent completely executes the same actions (accept, reject, and cancel) according their states as the corresponding subject acted through the emulation.

#### B.

 

#### Why vmac?

#### B. what about we transmit a wrong data?



### Experiment

1. How far and how fast can our vmac transmit data.

2. Compare: IEEE802.11a multicast, adhoc
3. Metric that indicate the advantage of our scheme. e.g. we can evaluate the average bit rate of cumulative distribution of all agents.
