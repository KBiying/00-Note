1. The key strengths of this paper are: (i) an architecture for ERL in edge networks, (ii) design of a new edge multicast protocol, that includes a naming scheme along with a transport protocol.

   However, although the idea is interesting, it is missing a compelling real world app. The paper would be much stronger if there was an application to accompany the protocol.

   我们做的就是real world 应用，意思是做一个功能完善的app？

   Consequently one of the biggest weaknesses of the paper is its evaluation. Acrobot and Cartpole are good control games, but do not represent the likely deployment scenario.

   实验本就是有局限性， 如何做到普适性？

   The fixed retransmission mechanism has a fixed number of transmissions to ensure data integrity. A more dynamic system could help improve the system's efficiency and reliability.

   重传机制需要更加完善， 这我知道。

   The paper also doesn't discuss dynamic group membership, or the scalability or **robustness of the proposed approach.**

   不需要dynamic group membership咧，没看论文？ scalability or robustness 我怎么说好呢？ 任何的强化学习的参数我都能传咧， robustness 确实不太好，重传很简单，没有cs， 没有checksum。



Designing custom network protocols to accelerate machine learning is quite interesting nowadays given how important ML workloads are proving to be.

However, the scenario in this paper seems very contrived to me:

1. What are some natural problems for which edge devices would have to perform reinforcement learning?
2. Why not collect the data and act (if necessary) on the edge, but do the learning itself in the cloud?
3. Is the bottleneck in this whole process the communication layer? I would expect it to be in computation, given RL is often one of the most computationally demanding forms of ML.

The paper doesn't provide the above motivation. Correspondingly the evaluation section is very weak, with measurements on two toy-like examples (from what I understand). The gain of roughly 35% over basic multi-cast makes me question the need for the network-level solution.

有提升就很不错了，还想要多少

If you have good answers to the above questions, and your evaluation shows serious e.g. over 2-3x end-to-end improvements in settings of actual value, this paper could be of interest.

1. When dealing with a large number of edge devices or more complex learning tasks, the scalability of the system may be limited, which may affect its efficiency and performance in these scenarios.

这个large number of edge devices怎么做实验好呢， 怎么用仿真做呢

1. This paper focuses on training and analysis for two specific games (Acrobot and CartPole), which may not be representative of a wider range of reinforcement learning problems and real-world applications.

​	有没有更具有广泛性的ERL场景？

1. Whether the inheritance reinforcement learning in edge environment proposed in this paper is only suitable for DQN? adding more other reinforcement learning models would be more convincing.

   我们是定制的， 报好意思。怎么抽象呢？

2. Further refinement of the naming scheme is recommended to better support network variations and to address potential security and privacy issues that may arise in edge network environments.

   既要又要，能解决安全问题我都出另一篇论文了

3. **The performance of the system under various network conditions (e.g., latency, packet loss, and congestion) has not been thoroughly explored, which may affect its applicability and reliability in real-world deployments.**

   **确实，这个有用。那这样的话， 我的对比试验也要加上 latency, packet loss, 还好， 但congestion怎么说明呢**
